    /* Siobhan is in the process of creating a brand new word game that she hopes will be super popular on the app store. 
Before she can put the app up though, she needs a way to determine whether or not a word will work for her game. 
She already knows the criteria, but needs your help to finish implementing the code. The criteria are:
*All words must be longer than 5 characters but shorter than 10 characters
*Words cannot start with 'X' or 'Q'
*If a word is exactly 7 characters long, it must end in s 


Hint:You will need to check if the last letter is equal to s. If a string has n characters, then itâ€™s last letter is at what index?*/
